# Workout Planner

# Description 
This is an interactive MERN Stack Application that functions as a workout planner for the user. The user can create an account or log in to their account and then begin choosing exercises that target specific body parts. Depending on which body part they choose, they will be presented with a list of workouts that target that specific body part. From there, they can build their own workout plan by adding sets and reps to their chosen workouts. There is also a "save workout" functionality where the logged in user can access previously saved workouts to review them.
